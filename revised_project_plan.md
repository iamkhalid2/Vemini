# Revised Real-time Video Assistant Project Plan

## Overview
A web application that processes video in near-real-time chunks, providing contextual understanding and voice interaction capabilities using Gemini's multimodal features.

## Architecture Revision

### 1. Video Processing Pipeline
- **Chunk-based Processing**
  - Capture short video segments (2-3 seconds)
  - Process chunks in parallel
  - Maintain sliding window of recent chunks for context
  - Upload chunks to Gemini via File API

- **Frame Extraction**
  - Extract key frames from chunks
  - Buffer frames for analysis
  - Maintain spatial context across frames

### 2. Memory System
- **Scene Graph Database**
  - Store object positions and relationships
  - Track object persistence across chunks
  - Maintain spatial context over time
  - Enable historical queries

### 3. Voice Interface
- **Input Processing**
  - Web Speech API for voice-to-text
  - Command parsing and intent detection
  - Context-aware query processing

- **Response Generation**
  - Text-to-speech synthesis
  - Real-time response streaming
  - Context-aware answers

### 4. Gemini Integration
- **Video Understanding**
  - Process video chunks using Gemini 2.0
  - Extract scene descriptions and object relationships
  - Maintain context between chunks

- **Spatial Understanding**
  - Track objects using 2D bounding boxes
  - Map spatial relationships
  - Enable location-based queries

### 5. Context Management
- **Short-term Memory**
  - Recent video chunks
  - Active objects and their states
  - Current conversation context

- **Long-term Memory**
  - Historical scene information
  - Object movement patterns
  - Past interactions and responses

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Set up video capture and chunking system
2. Implement chunk processing pipeline
3. Create basic scene graph database
4. Establish voice input/output system

### Phase 2: Gemini Integration
1. Implement video chunk processing with Gemini
2. Add spatial understanding capabilities
3. Create context management system
4. Set up response generation

### Phase 3: Memory System
1. Implement scene graph updates
2. Add spatial relationship tracking
3. Create query processing system
4. Enable historical lookups

### Phase 4: Voice Interface
1. Add voice command processing
2. Implement context-aware responses
3. Create response generation pipeline
4. Add text-to-speech output

### Phase 5: Real-time Optimization
1. Optimize chunk processing
2. Implement parallel processing
3. Add caching system
4. Optimize response times

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Chunk size optimization for real-time feel
- Parallel processing of chunks
- Memory management for continuous operation
- Response time optimization

### Limitations
1. Near-real-time vs True Real-time
   - 2-3 second delay due to chunk processing
   - Need to manage user expectations

2. Processing Overhead
   - Video chunk upload time
   - Gemini API processing time
   - Response generation delay

3. Memory Management
   - Limited context window
   - Selective persistence of important information
   - Efficient scene graph updates

### Error Handling
- Chunk processing failures
- API interruptions
- Voice recognition errors
- Context loss recovery

## Next Steps
1. Create proof-of-concept for chunk-based processing
2. Test Gemini API latency with video chunks
3. Implement basic voice interface
4. Build simple scene graph storage

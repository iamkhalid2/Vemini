# Creative Project Ideas using Gemini API

Here are some creative project ideas that leverage the unique capabilities of the Gemini API, going beyond typical applications:

## 1. Interactive Multimodal Storybook Generator

**Description:**  Create a tool that allows users to build interactive storybooks by combining text prompts with images, audio, and even short video clips. Gemini will generate story content, visual descriptions, and interactive elements.

**Unique Combinations:**

*   **Multimodal Input:** Text prompts, user-uploaded images, audio, and video.
*   **Multimodal Output:** Gemini-generated story text, image descriptions, and audio suggestions.
*   **Optional Features:** Code execution for interactive elements, streaming for dynamic story generation.

## 2. Real-time Multimodal Meeting Summarizer & Action Item Extractor

**Description:** Develop a tool that provides real-time meeting summaries and action item extraction by analyzing audio and visual (screen sharing) input during meetings.

**Unique Combinations:**

*   **Multimodal Input:** Live audio from meeting, screen sharing video/images.
*   **Gemini Capabilities:** Real-time audio and video understanding, search grounding for context, function calling for task management integration.
*   **Technology:** Leverages the Live API for real-time processing.

## 3. Personalized Multimodal Recipe Generator & Cooking Assistant

**Description:** Build a recipe generator that creates highly personalized recipes based on user preferences, dietary needs, and available ingredients (text, images, voice). It can then act as a cooking assistant with step-by-step instructions and visual/audio guidance.

**Unique Combinations:**

*   **Multimodal Input:** User preferences via text, ingredient images, voice descriptions.
*   **Multimodal Output:** Personalized recipe text, optional image generation of dishes, audio instructions.
*   **Optional Features:** Function calling for grocery list integration.

## 4. Interactive Multimodal Art Installation Guide

**Description:** Design an interactive guide for artists to plan and visualize art installations. Users describe their vision and provide space details (text, images, videos), and Gemini assists with planning and visualization.

**Unique Combinations:**

*   **Multimodal Input:** Text descriptions of artistic vision, images/videos of installation space.
*   **Gemini Capabilities:** Spatial understanding, text and image generation for plans and visualizations, code execution for interactive elements control.
